OpenFL-XAI is an extension to the open-source [Intel® OpenFL][openfl] framework for providing user-friendly support to Federated Learning (FL) of Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBS) as explainable-by-design models.
As an extension to OpenFL, OpenFL-XAI enables several data owners, possibly dislocated across different sites, to collaboratively train an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model while preserving the privacy of their raw data. An overview of the extensions to OpenFL that characterize OpenFL-XAI is reported in **openfl_changelog.txt**. <br/>
By supporting FL of highly interpretable FRBSs, OpenFL-XAI addresses two key requirements towards trustworthiness of AI systems, namely privacy preservation and transparency.

The current version of the framework includes the implementation of FL of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems for solving regression problems (please refer to [Bárcena et al., 2022][Barcena2022] for more details). However, the framework is composed by a set of general classes allowing developers to design additional rule-based systems and new aggregation schemes.

This work has been developed by the [Artificial Intelligence R&D Group][ai_rnd_group] at the Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, as part of the activities carried out within [Hexa-X Project, the European Union's Flagship 6G Project][hexa]. OpenFL-XAI has supported research, development, and demonstration activities concerning the FL of XAI models, which has been recently awarded as [key innovation][inno] by the EU Innovation Radar. This work has been also partially funded by the PNRR - M4C2 - Investimento 1.3, Partenariato Esteso PE00000013 - ``FAIR - Future Artificial Intelligence Research" - Spoke 1 ``Human-centered AI"
